### Installation notes for CKMR projects ###

Need to install:
-Tapenade
-Visual Studio C++ 2015 comunity edition
-Common tools for visual C++ 2015
-Windows 8.1 SDK and Universal CRT SDK 
(you can do the 3rd and 4th steps by searching for 'visual c++' in visual studio)
- Java (e.g. jdk-10.0.2) 

Make sure there's a system environment variable called 'Java_Home' pointed at the java directory (e.g. 'c:\progra~1\java\jdk-10.0.2')

Edit Visual Studio 'property manager - Microsoft.Cpp.x64.user' (these provide common access locations for headers across multiple projects).  Under
Common Properties >> VC++ Directories, change 'Include Directories' to have path to header files (e.g. 'c:\adt\include' and 'c:\adt\include\Rmath').  I
didn't have to do this before when MVB was helping me, so there's probably some ways to get around this step.  You also need to provide access to several library folders
(e.g. C:\ADT\lib\x64\debug and C:\ADT\lib\x64\R).

ADT -Need to run new.adt() to set up skeleton for new project
#first run
install.packages("//akc0ss-n086/NMML_USERS/paul.conn/Downloads/newadt_1.03.zip",repos=NULL,type="win.binary")
#Mark emailed this to me - I also saved it in the templates folder

library(newadt)
new.adt("c:/users/paul.conn/git/CKMR","Bearded","Bd") #OR
new.adt("c:/users/paul.conn/git/CKMR","Bearded2","Bd",src.templates=file.path(dirname(Sys.which('adt.exe')),'../templates/ckmr'))


To run in R:
-Need to get function load_ADT_DLL from fitbits.R
-do "attach to process" from Debug window in VS to integrate R session with C++ (debugging, access of C objects)

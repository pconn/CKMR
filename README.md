Close kin mark-recapture simulation and analysis

Includes code to simulate and analyze a toy beluga whale example from the workshop M. Bravington gave at the ASA meeting in Fairbanks.

Includes code to simulate and analyze bearded seal half-sibling and parent-offspring relationships given sex- and age-specific fecundity and survival.

Includes code to run spatial simulations for manuscript submitted to MEE.  The primary script for this is "./inst/run_spatial_sims.R" - note that the estimation code for this is in './bearded2/x64/debug/bearded2' but that actually running it requires setup of the ADT package and Tampenade libraries - see e.g. https://github.com/pjumppanen/ADT, the adt_setup folder, and install_notes.txt for some helpful hints
